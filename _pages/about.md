I am a PhD student in Computer Science at University Lyon 2, advised by Prof. [Serge Miguet](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=fr&user=jLh0qIEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), and Prof. [Xavier Marsault](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xavier-Marsault). I earned my MS in Artificial Intelligence, 3D, and Development from University of Clermont Auvergne, where I was supervised by Prof. [Laure Tougne](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=fr&user=ecaeLFYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), and Dr. [Carlos Crispim-Junior](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UwZieOoAAAAJ&hl=en), and my BS in Computer Science from University of Science and Technology Oran.

My research focuses on Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Generative Models, and Graph Neural Networks.
